# TitanicDataPython
For my DSC-140 Class, this is part of report 1
  The file Report_1 is a python notebook created in jupyter this code contains
the excel csv file titanic_train.csv which was the data set that was used in 
the jupyter notebook. In the notebook is three imported libraries pandas to handle
data sets and data frames, matplotlib to create graphs, and scipy to do maths. The 
first thing done was creating a histogram which I customized the x-axis, y-axis, 
title, color of the graph, and then saving it to an image in the dedicated folder.
The next thing was a pie chart which was a representation of the sex column in the
data set. It was customized to my liking as well as saved as an image. Next was
a scatter plot of two numerical columns of data SibSp and Parch. To go with the graph
I also wanted a linear regression model. I used scipy to calculate this for me. Then
it was plotted to the graph as a scatter plot which was also customized. There was 
extra code that needed to be added in order to graph the linear regression model as 
well its equation. To finish off the scatter plot I added the correlation coeficient
and save the graph as an image. I created a correlation matrix to show which columns 
were correlated with one another. I saved the correlation matrix as an image. I used
the crosstab method in the pandas library to get a contingency table to see if there
were any relations between the class of the passengers and their gender. I described 
my findings in a print statement. The last thing I did was compare two columns,
specifically I compared to see how much money all the first class passengers paid.
